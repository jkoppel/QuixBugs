Total: 40 Python programs, given by Quixey, in correct and incorrect versions
Java is missing is_valid_parenthesization and topological_ordering
some algorithms require other objects to exist in the environment/namespace
how can I reference Nodes programmatically?

Notes:
JSON only has Number. The JavaDeserializer has a workaround for Integers.
This restricts us to using Integers, Floats, and Strings in the JSON testcases.
JSON strings must use doublequotes, otherwise GSON throws MalformedJsonExceptions.
Unfortunately Python treats single and double quotes identically, and outputs with single quotes. Thus we use reenconding into (compact) JSON.

Datatypes/Structures:
bitcount: nonnegative int, N -> N
bucketsort: list of small ints, upperbound of size of ints in arr. So array access by indexing, array extension, getindex, index retrieval
flatten: array, list. really it's a heterogeneous list (nested list structure) or tree. outputs a generator 
find_first_in_sorted: array, sorted list of ints and an int value to find
find_in_sorted: array, sorted list of ints
gcd: nonnegative ints, modulo
get_factors: **, %, int, return list of ints
hanoi: int, returns ordered list of pairs, requires array with extend, append, and pop
is_valid_parenthesization: string, iterating over string, returns Boolean
kheapsort: heapq, heapify, heappushpop, heappop, yield, returns generator
kth: list of ints, array, len of list, list comprehension to split
longest_common_subsequence: string, string, recursion, max function by key, cutting the string
lcs_length: from collections import Counter, string, some way to get values of the Counter
levenshtein: string, string, min, recursion, string cutting
lis: arr of ints (list here), getIndex, index access, list comprehension, dictionary
max_sublist_sum: array/list of ints, for-loop over arr
mergesort: arr/list of ints, ability to append, extend, recursion, cut array, index access, define function
next_permutation: list of unique ints, iterate backwards (range function), index access, reverse list, substitute chunks of array with array
next_palindrome: array/list of digits, //, index access, ability to construct the original datatype through +
pascal: int, list of lists of ints, range, append, double index-acess
possible_change: list of positive ints, int, recursion
powerset: array of nonduplicate elements, output list of lists, generic lists, first/rest, list comprehension
quicksort: list of ints, list comprehension with filters, construct original datatype using +
rpn_eval: list of floats and strings, define function, test if float, append, pop
shunting_yard: list of tokens in infix notation, list of int or string, append, pop, isinstance, index access of last item
sieve: int, list append, range, %
sqrt: float, absolute value, /, while loop, >
subsequences: int, positive int, array/list extend, ability to construct array type with + also list comprehension
to_base: string.digits, string.ascii_uppercase
wrap: string, positive int, rfind for text, append, slicing

breadth_first_search: deque Queue, digraph Nodes, queue popleft, queue extend, queue append, list comprehension w/ filter, set, set update
depth_first_search: digraph Nodes, set, function definition, any, map/list comprehension, node.successors
detect_cycle: what's this equals thing?, head Node of linked list, node.successor
knapsack: defaultdict
minimum_spanning_tree: dict of the form {(u,v): weight} for each undirected graph edge, set, dict sorting, set add, dict update
reverse_linked_list: head node of singly linked list
shortest_path_length: MinHeap / FibHeap, heap insert, dict, nodes, pop, add, float('inf')
shortest_path_lengths: dict keyed by ordered pair of node ids, nodes with ids, outputs a dict, defaultdict, float('inf'), directed_graph
shortest_paths: directed graph node, dict of edge weights keyed by ordered pair of node ids, dict, float('inf'), min
topological_ordering: directed graph nodes, orderedset, node.incoming_nodes, issuperset, node.outgoing_nodes
